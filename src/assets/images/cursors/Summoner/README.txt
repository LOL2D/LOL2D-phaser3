Thanks for downloading my cursor! Good luck in the Rift!

Install:
	1. Download and extract Summoner.zip
	2. Right click install.inf
	3. Click "install"
	4. Navigate to Settings>Devices>Mouse>Additional mouse options>Pointers
	5. Select "Summoner" Scheme from drop down menu
	6. Hit "OK"
Extras:
	-In case you want to use some of the extra images as a cursor, 
	just replace the original in the "Summoner" folder **using the name of the original**
	
	i.e. 	1. drag "extra_move_2.cur" into main "Summoner" folder
		2. relocate original "move.cur" for safe keeping (put in "extra" folder maybe)
		3. rename "extra_move_2.cur" to "move.cur"
		4. make sure to delete scheme and reinstall if already installed prior to
		   replacing an orig with an extra
